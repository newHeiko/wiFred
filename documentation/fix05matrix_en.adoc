Intensive use of the wiFred of revisions 0.5 and 0.51 revealed a mistake in the way the LEDs and key switches are connected to the AVR on PCBs with rev0.5 and rev0.51: In certain situations, pressing one function key will be read as multiple key presses. This is most obvious with F2, F5 or F8 also activating ESTOP. This document describes a fix which has been implemented successfully in many wiFreds and also incorporated into the rev0.52 PCB and schematic. It removes the LEDs from the key read-in matrix.

== Tools and parts needed

This work requires some solder wick, a total of three 220-Ohm THT resistors of size 0207 (the usual 0.25W carbon film or 0.6W metal film types are fine) and some length of heat-shrink tube of about 2.4mm diameter.

To update the firmware, an AVR programmer for the regular AVR ISP connector P201 on the PCB is required.

== How to fix, step by step

First, remove the SMD resistors R302, R303 and R304 as shown in <<fix05matrix-001>> and <<fix05matrix-002>> and clean their pads with some solder wick.

Next, get the first of the 220-Ohm THT resistors (size 0207), cut and bend the leads very short so it connects Pin 1 of P201 to the outer pad of former R304 and solder it as shown in <<fix05keymatrix-003>>.

The second 220-Ohm THT resistors needs a little more shaping of its leads. It should connect pin 3 of P201 (center pin in the upper row) with the inner, left pad of former R303, as shown in <<fix05keymatrix-004>>. As the longer lead of that resistor passes close to a couple of metal pieces in the wiFred, it is recommended to cut a piece of heat-shrink tube and fit it over the bare metal of the lead, as shown in <<fix05keymatrix-005>>. It is not required to actually shrink it as it will be held in place by the resistor and the solder point.

The final 220-Ohm THT resistor is installed in a similar fashion to the second one, also attaching to pin 3 of P201 and connecting it to the center (upper) pad of former R302 as shown in <<fix05keymatrix-006>>. It also has a long bare lead floating close to other metal parts, so insulation with heat-shrink tube is recommended. Also it blocks access to the lower right (in the picture) screw attaching the PCB to the housing, so either bend it a little different from the picture, remove the screw or make sure access to the top side of the PCB is not required.

== Software required

To make the LEDs light up with their new connections, a new AVR firmware is required. It is distributed through the github repository and dated 2025-03-26.

Before updating the AVR firmware, it is recommended to update the ESP12 firmware through the web interface of the wiFred. As of this writing, any firmware with -esp12.bin in the filename should work, starting from 2022-10-16-ff2c954-esp12.bin.
